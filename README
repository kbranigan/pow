This application accomplishes (when it's compiled):
  1. Connects to MySQL on localhost
  2. Auto-Discovers all tables from a db of your choosing
  3. Creates models in C for those tables
  4. Creates another C application which:
      I. Connects to MySQL on localhost
      II. loads all the content of your tables into ram (using the previously created C models)
      III. provides a basic web interface to access that ram-cached content
